# Week 2 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Welcome to the repository for **Week 2** of our Java learning journey. This week focuses on the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java â€” a critical step in building modular, maintainable, and scalable applications.

## Overview

In Week 2, we explore the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Java. These principles form the backbone of real-world Java development, enabling developers to write clean, reusable, and modular code. This week provides hands-on exposure to designing and implementing object-oriented systems using classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Classes and Objects
- Understanding classes and objects in Java
- Declaring and defining class members (variables and methods)
- Creating objects using the `new` keyword
- Instance variables and method invocation
- Basic memory concepts associated with object creation

### Day 2: Constructors and `this` Keyword
- Defining constructors and their purpose
- Constructor overloading
- Using the `this` keyword to reference instance variables
- Calling one constructor from another using `this()`

### Day 3: Inheritance
- Concept of inheritance and code reuse
- Using the `extends` keyword
- Single inheritance in Java
- Accessing superclass members
- The `super` keyword for constructor and method access

### Day 4: Polymorphism
- Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding)
- Dynamic method dispatch
- Use of the `instanceof` operator

### Day 5: Abstraction and Interfaces
- Introduction to abstract classes and abstract methods
- Defining and implementing interfaces
- Multiple inheritance using interfaces
- Real-world examples demonstrating abstraction

### Day 6: Access Modifiers, Static, and Final Keywords
- Java access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default
- Static variables and methods
- Final variables, methods, and classes
- Use cases for `static` and `final` in application design

## Prerequisites

Before beginning Week 2, ensure the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed and configured
- Familiarity with Java basics covered in [Week 1](../Week1)
- A suitable IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is organized into folders corresponding to each day's topic. Each folder contains Java source files that illustrate the concepts discussed on that day. To make the most of this repository:

- Browse the daily folders to review code samples and examples
- Run and debug the Java files to observe behavior
- Modify the code to reinforce your understanding and test different scenarios

This structure is designed to facilitate hands-on practice and reinforce key OOP concepts.
